"""Rewrites the app numbers in README.md from https://nicedreamzwholesale.com/software/stats.json.

The Mac mini rebuilds stats.json twice a day from Apple's sales reports and Google Play's install
files. This keeps the profile honest without anyone remembering to update it (the table was
typed by hand until 2026-09-27 and went stale within a week).
Only text between the <!--X:START--> / <!--X:END--> markers is touched.
